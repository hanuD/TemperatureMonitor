Temeperature Monitor built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and LM35 temperature sensors.

Multiple temperature sensors are connected to Arduino ports and constantly send the temperature.
Arduino relays back the temperature to Raspberry Pi every 5 seconds and Raspberry Pi sends a POST request to a server application.

The server application creates a corresponding entry in MongoDB and displays the temperature graph to the user.

Tech stack used

Raspberry Pi - Python
Arduino - arduino library
Server application - Java, Spring, mongorepository and javascript libraries.
