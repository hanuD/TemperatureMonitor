Temperature Monitor built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and LM35 temperature sensors.

Multiple LM35 temperature sensors are connected to the Arduino analog ports and these sensors constantly report the temperature to Arduino.
Arduino relays back the temperature to Raspberry Pi every 5 seconds. Raspberry Pi sends a POST request to a server application. The script running in raspberry pi also sends text messages based on temperature thresaholds.

The server application creates a corresponding entry in MongoDB for future use and displays the temperature graph to the user.

Tech stack used

Raspberry Pi - Python
Arduino - arduino library
Server application - Java, Spring, mongorepository and Flot for graph.
